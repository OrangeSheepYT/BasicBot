# BasicBot
A basic example of a Discord Bot in Python.

Everything you need is located in "bot.py" which is available above. (Feel free to take code from my other projects.)

For this code to work I would recommend for you to have **Python Version 3.6.0** installed.

I would also recommend you have **Discord.py** downloaded. (Open cmd and type py -m pip install discord.py) :D

# Inviting Your Bot
Below is an example of how you can invite your bot to a server!
If you want others to use your bot be sure to click "**Public Bot**" and give the link you generated to other people.
You can mess around with the permissions if you know what you're doing, but giving it Administrator gives it full power!

# How To Install Discord.py (Latest Version)

If you don't plan on adding voice support (music or sfx) to your bot please run the command below in a Command Prompt window.

```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

If you plan on adding voice support (music or sfx) to your your bot please run the command below in a Command Prompt window.

```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
```

I would recommend the one with voice support so you have it just in case you need it. If you are not sure if you have discord.py run the prefered command just in case, there is no harm in doing so.

**If you type one of the commands and it says:**
```
'python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```
Just replace **python3** with **python**
